# Analog-Clock
An analog clock is a classic timekeeping device that uses moving hands to indicate the time on a circular dial. The hour, minute, and second hands rotate around the clock face to show the current time. It provides a simple yet elegant way to read time at a glance. Analog clocks are often used in homes, offices, and public places.
